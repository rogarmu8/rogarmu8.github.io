Welcome! I am Rómulo, a passionate and innovative computer scientist and software engineer based in Madrid, Spain. My journey in the realm of technology began at the Autonomous University of Madrid, where I delved deep into the intricate world of computer science. Curiosity has always been the driving force behind my exploration of how things work, propelling me to push the boundaries of conventional knowledge and seek out new ways to simplify everyday life.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate and create a more efficient, interconnected, and innovative world together.

Best regards,

Rómulo García.
