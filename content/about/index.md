Welcome! I am Rómulo, a passionate and innovative computer scientist and software engineer based in Madrid, Spain. My journey in the realm of technology began at the Autonomous University of Madrid, where I delved deep into the intricate world of computer science. I always wondered how things worked, tried creating and developing new projects to make everybody's day to day life easier.


I am currently working in GMV as a fullstack software developer for european defense projects.

The technologies that I use the most in a day to day basis are Java Swing, Liferay, Python, PyTorch, OpenCV and Docker.

Best regards,

Rómulo García.
