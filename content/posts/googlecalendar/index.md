E-ink display that connects to your google calendar and retrieves the data from the next 6 days updating every 24 hours.


# Parts used:

 -  https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/E-Paper_ESP32_Driver_Board
 -  https://www.waveshare.com/product/7.5inch-e-paper.htm
 
# Explanation:
 
 - We use google scripts to connect to our google calendar and retrieve the needed information.
 - After doing such, from our esp32 we connect to the scripts application and retrieve the data from the html reponse.
 - We give format to the response to have a better integrationwith the e-ink display.
 - We print it to the display using the waveshare library for arduino. (Make sure you have all libraries and drivers download and installed correctly to be able to connect to the display)
 - The data will update every 24 Hours, restarting the device will force an update at any time.

# Example of data retrieved from google scripts:
